# MachineLearning
ML1 contains a python implementation of machine learning algorithms like classification tree, adaboost and regression tree from scratch

ML2 contains python implementations of different machine learning models and data visualizations for anazlyzing Walmart:

Data:

You have been provided with sales data (sales.csv) for 111 products whose
sales may be affected by the weather (such as milk, bread, umbrellas, etc.).
These 111 products are sold in stores at 45 different Walmart locations. Some
of the products may be a similar item (such as milk) but have a different id
in different stores/regions/suppliers.
The 45 locations are covered by 20 weather stations (i.e., some of the stores
are nearby and share a weather station). The key data (key.csv) indicates for
each store to which weather station it belongs.
In addition, you have been provided with the weather data (weather.csv) of
each weather station.
The data can be found here.
The sales and weather data are daily observations, from January 2012 to
October 2014.
You should use the observations from the years 2012-2013 as your training
data, and the observations from the year 2014 as your test data.

ML3 is similar to ML2 but the data is different, USA elections, and has different goals, it also has and additional implementation of dimensionality reduction algorthims and adding new features based on existing ones

About the data:

You have been provided with data regarding US elections, general county
information, life expectancies, economic data and more. The variables
description can be found in the data-variables-description.pdf file. In
addition, the background-information.pdf file provides information
regarding the US elections system in case you are not familiar with it.
